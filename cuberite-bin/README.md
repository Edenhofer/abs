# Minecraft Server Management Script

The management script to control this minecraft flavor was moved to a dedicated repository at [GitHub:Edenhofer/minecraft-server](https://github.com/Edenhofer/minecraft-server).
The script works for various flavors of minecraft.
It is very minimalist yet versatile and feature-rich.
For more information on how to configure and install the script separately, visit the above linked repository.
